				<p id="pdetail"> Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio!</p> 
				<p> A little about myself:</p> 
				<p> I am in the process of changing careers from the field of counseling in order to pursue web development. I started front-end self study for about 5 months in 2016 and never looked back.  Once I had my son in May, I knew I needed to be fully immersed into coding (outside of the house) if I were to ever become proficient in Javascript and beyond. This is when I decided to apply and enter into the Coding Bootcamp&#39;s Full-stack Web Development program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill!  Best decision I&#39;ve ever made! I love what I do and look forward to continuing the expansion of my knowledge base and experience.  Please feel free to take a look at my current projects as well as <span id="p2detail">stalk</span> browse through my dev footprint on GitHub and Stackoverflow.</p>

				<p> Current competencies include: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Git, Responsive Web Design, UX/UI <br><br>
 
				Fun facts about me: Yes I love cats&#8230;  cat. Just one.  I like cheese and imported prosciutto, driving manual (and fast!), vidgeo games, playing sports rather than watching, piano is cool, traveling, and of course, wait for ittt&#8230; coding :) <br><br>

				Don&#39;t hesitate to reach out to me so we can chat more about web development!
 				</p>
